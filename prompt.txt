I have two projects:

Novus Inc Project – this is my main project whose contents, structure, and functionality must remain the same.

AcademyLandingPage Directory – this project has a different development stack and styling that I want to adopt for the Novus Inc project.

Your task is to:

Investigate both projects thoroughly — analyze the frameworks, libraries, folder structures, and technologies used in each.

Identify the development stack and style system used in academylandingpage (for example, Next.js, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, etc.).

Compare it with the current Novus Inc project stack and document the differences.

Plan a migration strategy that keeps all the content, layout hierarchy, and features of Novus Inc exactly the same, but rebuilds it using the same stack and visual style as academylandingpage.

Outline what needs to change — dependencies, build system, folder structure, component design, CSS framework, etc.

Explain what can be reused and what will need to be refactored or rewritten.

Deliver a migration roadmap — step-by-step guide to refactor or rebuild Novus Inc with the academylandingpage tech stack and design style, without altering its functional or textual content.

Keep the content identical, only the tech stack and visual design system should change to match
